# Individual Research Project - Controlling Robots with Neural-Networks - Second Experience - Robot Arm - GTE method 

This repository contains all the code required to run the second experience of Alexandre Chenu's Individual Research Project 
applied to a 2D Robot arm. The objective is to learn both high-performing and diverse controllers for a Hexapod Robot to reach 
a unkwown points all orver the work space. In this experience, an archive of approximately 1000 Neural Networks controllers is learned 
using a Quality-Diversity algorithm. Each Neural Network controller has a target encoded in its genotype and is trained on this single target.

## TODO:

1. Clean code 
2. Integrate to a singularity container
